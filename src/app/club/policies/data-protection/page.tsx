      <h2>1. About this Policy</h2>

      <p>
        This Policy is to help the club deal with data protection matters
        internally. This should be kept with other club policies and a copy
        should be given (or made available) to all staff members, volunteers and
        others who come into contact with personal data during the course of
        their involvement with the club.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Feering Falcons YFC handle personal data about current players,
        their parents or guardians, volunteers, committee members, coaches,
        managers and any other individuals that we communicate with.
      </p>

      <p>
        In your official capacity with the Club you may process personal data on
        our behalf and we will process personal data about you. We recognise the
        need to treat all personal data in an appropriate and lawful manner, in
        accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).
      </p>

      <p>
        Correct and lawful treatment of this data will maintain confidence with
        the Club and protect the rights of players and any other individuals
        associated with the Club. This Policy sets out our data protection
        responsibilities and highlights the obligations of our committee,
        volunteers, members, and any other contractor or legal or natural
        individual or organisation acting for or on behalf of the Club.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are obliged to comply with this policy when processing personal data
        on behalf of the Club and this policy will help you to understand how to
        handle personal data.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Club committee will be responsible for ensuring compliance with this
        Policy. Any questions about this Policy or data protection concerns
        should be referred to the committee.
      </p>

      <p>
        We process volunteers, members, coaches, managers and committee for
        administrative and Club management purposes. Our purpose for holding
        this personal data is to be able to contact relevant individuals on Club
        business and our legal basis for processing your personal data in this
        way is the contractual relationship we have with you. We will keep this
        data for the duration of the playing season with the Club, unless
        required otherwise by law and/or regulatory requirements. If you do not
        provide your personal data for this purpose, you will not be able to
        carry out your role or the obligations of your membership with the Club.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What we need from you</h2>

      <p>
        To assist with our compliance with UK GDPR we will need you to comply
        with the terms of this policy. We have set out the key guidance in this
        section but please do read the full policy carefully.
      </p>

      <p>Please help us to comply with the data protection principles:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Please ensure that you only process data in accordance with our
          transparent processing as set out in our Privacy Notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please only process personal data for the purposes for which we have
          collected it. If you want to do something different with it, please
          speak to the Club Secretary first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please do not ask for further information about players and/or members
          and/or staff and/or volunteers without first checking with the Club
          Secretary.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are asked to correct an individual&apos;s personal data, please
          make sure that you can identify that individual and, where you have
          been able to identify them, make the relevant updates on our records
          and systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please comply with our retention periods listed in our Privacy Notice
          and make sure that if you still have information which falls outside of
          those dates, that you delete/destroy it securely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please treat all personal data as confidential. If it is stored in
          electronic format then please consider whether the documents themselves
          should be password protected or whether your personal computer is
          password protected and whether you can limit the number of people who
          have access to the information. If it is stored in hard copy format
          then please make sure it is locked away safely and is not kept in a car
          overnight or disposed of in a public place.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are looking at using a new electronic system for the storage of
          information, please talk to the Club Secretary first so that we can
          decide whether such a system is appropriately secure and complies with
          UK GDPR.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are planning on sharing personal data with anybody new or with a
          party outside the FA structure then please speak to the Club Secretary
          before doing so, who will be able to check that the correct contractual
          provisions are in place and that we have a lawful basis to share the
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you receive a subject access request (or you think somebody is
          making a subject access request for access to the information we hold
          on them) then please tell the Club Secretary as soon as possible
          because we have strict timelines in which to comply.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you think there has been a data breach (for example you have lost
          personal data or a personal device which contains personal data, or you
          have sent an email and open copied all contacts in) then please speak
          to the Club Secretary who will be able to help you to respond.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you have any questions at any time then please just ask the Club
        Secretary. We are here to help.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data protection principles</h2>

      <p>
        Anyone processing personal data must comply with the enforceable
        principles of data protection. Personal data must be:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner</li>
        <li>
          Collected for only specified, explicit and legitimate purposes
        </li>
        <li>
          Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purpose(s)
          for which it is processed
        </li>
        <li>Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date</li>
        <li>
          Kept in a form which permits identification of individuals for no
          longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed
        </li>
        <li>
          Processed in a manner that ensures its security by appropriate
          technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or
          unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We are responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with
        the data protection principles listed above.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Fair and lawful processing</h2>

      <p>
        This Policy aims to ensure that our data processing is done fairly and
        without adversely affecting the rights of the individual. Lawful
        processing means data must be processed on one of the legal bases set
        out in the UK GDPR. When special category personal data is being
        processed, additional conditions must be met.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Processing for limited purposes</h2>

      <p>
        The Club collects and processes personal data. This is data we receive
        directly from an individual and data we may receive from other sources.
        We will only process personal data for the purposes of registering with
        the Club, County FA and the Leagues in which we are playing as
        instructed by the committee, the County FA or The FA, or as specifically
        permitted by the UK GDPR. We will let individuals know what those
        purposes are when we first collect the data or as soon as possible
        thereafter.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Consent</h2>

      <p>
        One of the lawful bases on which we may be processing data is the
        individual&apos;s consent. An individual consents to us processing their
        personal data if they clearly indicate specific and informed agreement,
        either by a statement or positive action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Individuals must be easily able to withdraw their consent at any time
        and withdrawal must be promptly honoured. Consents should be refreshed
        every season.
      </p>

      <p>
        Explicit consent is usually required for automated decision-making and
        for cross-border data transfers, and for processing special category
        personal data. Where children are involved then the consent must be in
        writing from parent/guardian.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where consent is our legal basis for processing, we will need to keep
        records of when and how this consent was captured. Our Privacy Notice
        sets out the lawful bases on which we process data of our players and
        members.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Notifying individuals</h2>

      <p>
        Where we collect personal data directly from individuals, we will inform
        them about the purpose(s) for which we intend to process that personal
        data, the legal basis on which we are processing it, and their rights as
        data subjects. If we receive personal data about an individual from
        other sources, we will provide this information as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Adequate, relevant and non-excessive processing</h2>

      <p>
        We will only collect personal data that is required for the specific
        purpose notified to the individual. You may only process personal data
        if required to do so in your official capacity with the Club. The Club
        must ensure that when personal data is no longer needed for specified
        purposes, it is deleted or anonymised.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Accurate data</h2>

      <p>
        We will ensure that personal data we hold is accurate and kept up to
        date. We will check the accuracy of any personal data at the point of
        collection and at the start of each season. We will take all reasonable
        steps to destroy or amend inaccurate or out-of-date data.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Timely processing</h2>

      <p>
        We will not keep personal data longer than is necessary for the
        purpose(s) for which they were collected. We will take all reasonable
        steps to destroy or delete data which is no longer required, as per our
        Privacy Notice.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Processing in line with data subjects&apos; rights</h2>

      <p>As data subjects, all individuals have the right to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Be informed of what personal data is being processed</li>
        <li>
          Request access to any data held about them by a data controller
        </li>
        <li>
          Object to processing of their data for direct-marketing purposes
        </li>
        <li>Ask to have inaccurate or incomplete data rectified</li>
        <li>Be forgotten (deletion or removal of personal data)</li>
        <li>Restrict processing</li>
        <li>Data portability</li>
        <li>
          Not be subject to a decision which is based on automated processing
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Club is aware that not all individuals&apos; rights are absolute,
        and any requests regarding the above should be immediately reported to
        the committee, and if applicable escalated to the County FA for
        guidance.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Data security</h2>

      <p>
        We will take appropriate security measures against unlawful or
        unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the accidental
        loss of, or damage to, personal data. We have proportionate procedures
        and technology to maintain the security of all personal data. Personal
        data will only be transferred to another party to process on our behalf
        (a data processor) where we have a UK GDPR-compliant written contract in
        place with that data processor.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Disclosure and sharing of personal information</h2>

      <p>
        We share personal data with the County FA and The FA, and with
        applicable leagues using Whole Game System. We may share personal data
        with third parties or suppliers for the services they provide.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Transferring personal data outside the UK</h2>

      <p>
        We may transfer any personal data we hold to a country outside the UK,
        provided that one of the appropriate safeguards applies.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Reporting a personal data breach</h2>

      <p>
        In the case of a breach of personal data, we may need to notify the
        applicable regulatory body (the ICO) and the individual. If you know or
        suspect that a personal data breach has occurred, inform a member of the
        committee immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Dealing with subject access requests</h2>

      <p>
        Individuals may make a formal request for information we hold about
        them. Anyone who receives such a request should forward it to the
        committee immediately. Nobody should feel bullied or pressured into
        disclosing personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>17. Accountability</h2>

      <p>
        The Club must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures
        to look after personal data, and is responsible for, and must be able to
        demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles.
      </p>

      <h2>18. Changes to this policy</h2>

      <p>
        We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. Where
        appropriate, we will notify you by email.
