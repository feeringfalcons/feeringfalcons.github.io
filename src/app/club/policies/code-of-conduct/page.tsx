      <h2>Team Manager</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          As a Team Manager, you by your actions and conduct, should set a good
          example at all times, for your players, parents/guardians and
          spectators.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read and understand the code for participants and spectators. Actively
          promote and adhere to these codes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the safety and well-being of each player above all other
          considerations including the result of the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that each player is correctly dressed with the necessary safety
          equipment, shin pads etc., before being allowed to play.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get treatment for an injured player immediately and co-operate fully
          with other specialists in the best interest of the player.
        </li>
        <li>
          Never either physically or mentally push children beyond their
          abilities. The game is of minor consideration when compared to the
          child&apos;s future health and well-being.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage and guide players to accept responsibility for their own
          behaviour and performance. Never condone unacceptable behaviour by not
          acting upon it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always ensure you are prompt, courteous and correct when dealing with
          League Officials, opposition Managers, Referees and Assistant Referees.
          Confirm venues, times and dates etc, as early as possible and at
          reasonable times during the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read, understand and be aware of your responsibilities as laid down in
          your League Handbook.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check that you have the necessary equipment, documentation and first
          aid kit before you leave for the match or training.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read the Laws of the Game and assist your players in understanding
          them.
        </li>
        <li>Promote the Club&apos;s Code of Conduct.</li>
        <li>
          Agree, within a 12-month period, to take part in an educational course
          organised by the respective League, County Football Association or the
          National Football Association.
        </li>
        <li>
          Agree to a DBS check with regard to your suitability to work with
          children.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Parent, Guardian, Carer &amp; Spectator</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Do not force an unwilling child to participate in football.</li>
        <li>
          Remember children are involved in football for their enjoyment, not
          yours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage your child to play to the Laws of the Game and not to argue
          with Referees and other officials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teach your child that honest effort is more important than victory so
          that the result of each game is accepted without undue disappointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn losing into winning by helping your child work towards skill
          improvement and good sportsmanship. Never ridicule or yell at your
          child for making a mistake or losing a game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember that children learn by best example. Applaud good play by your
          team and by members of the opposition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not question the Referee&apos;s judgement or honesty. Remember
          he/she is only human with the same feelings as you and like you,
          sometimes may make an honest error.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support all efforts to remove verbal and physical abuse from
          children&apos;s football.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recognise the value and importance of coaches who are all volunteers.
          They give children their time and resources to provide football for
          your child.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recognise your responsibility to deliver your child to training and
          matches, both home and away, on time. Collect your child promptly at
          the end of the training session/match. The club is not a cr&egrave;che.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read the Laws of the Game to understand better what you are looking at
          and commenting on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be on your best behaviour. Do not use abusive language or harass,
          physically or verbally, players, managers, coaches, referees or
          assistant referees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Applaud all good play by both your team and the other team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Show respect for your team&apos;s opponents. Without them there would
          be no game.
        </li>
        <li>Condemn the use of violence and verbal abuse.</li>
        <li>
          Promote this Code of Conduct amongst other Parents/Guardians &amp;
          Spectators.
        </li>
      </ol>
